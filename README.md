## Code quality and security
FlatPress uses automated checks to improve code quality and security:

- [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) is executed with every change to detect potential errors, unclean code and violations of best practices at an early stage.
- [CodeQL](https://github.com/github/codeql) analyzes the source code for known security risks and vulnerabilities through semantic code analysis.

These tools run automatically via **GitHub Actions**, both for pull requests and regularly in the background.
