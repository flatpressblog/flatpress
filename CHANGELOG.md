# Under development: FlatPress 1.5

## Changed requirements
- FlatPress 1.5 runs under PHP up to **8.4**; minimum required PHP version increases to **7.2**.

## General
### Changes
- General
  - Fewer race conditions thanks to local cache, optionally supported by APCu. ([#667](https://github.com/flatpressblog/flatpress/issues/667), [#673](https://github.com/flatpressblog/flatpress/pull/673), [#675](https://github.com/flatpressblog/flatpress/pull/675), [#679](https://github.com/flatpressblog/flatpress/pull/679))
  - Correct output when a historical character set encoding is set. ([#670](https://github.com/flatpressblog/flatpress/pull/670))
- Template engine:
  - Smarty updated to version 5.6.0 with PHP 8.4 support ([#651](https://github.com/flatpressblog/flatpress/pull/651))<br><sub><i>
Smarty 5 now always runs in multibyte mode. Make sure you use the PHP [multibyte extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php) in production for optimal performance.</i></sub>
  - No code changes required with new, stable Smarty version.
  - FlatPress automatically loads the latest PSR-4 stub.
- The new Smarty Modifier ``|ver``  uses a new core function, utils_asset_ver(), to assign the FlatPress version to Java scripts and stylesheets. This ensures that the visitor's browser only uses the updated files. ([#629](https://github.com/flatpressblog/flatpress/issues/629))
- Admin area:
    - Uploader revised to multi-file uploader  ([#656](https://github.com/flatpressblog/flatpress/pull/656), [#46](https://github.com/flatpressblog/flatpress/issues/46))
    - Widget-panel revisited  ([#659](https://github.com/flatpressblog/flatpress/pull/659))
        - Stylesheet is now also loaded by themes that do not have a design for the widget panel.
        - From left to right/ Available widgets to widget bar
        - Flex version with wrapper and responsive
        - Drag & drop now also available for mobile devices 

### Security
- Detection of an HTTP/HTTPS connection ``is_https()`` is significantly more reliable and less susceptible to spoofing. Improved detection for public proxies/CDNs, including Azure and Cloudflare. ([#672](https://github.com/flatpressblog/flatpress/pull/672))

### Bugfixes
- If ``$_SERVER [‘HTTPS’] = off`` is set in the web server, an HTTP connection is now correctly recognized. ([#671](https://github.com/flatpressblog/flatpress/issues/671))
- ``theme_style_exists()`` now returns ``''`` if the style directory is missing. Previously, the theme root was returned incorrectly. ([#678](https://github.com/flatpressblog/flatpress/pull/678))
